MSNet / LS-Net: Multi-Scale Representation Networks for Time Series Classification  Reference PyTorch implementation of MSNet and LS-Net, two lightweight multi-scale CNN architectures for time series classification. The repository provides model implementations and runnable demos on UCR datasets.

# MSNet / LS-Net

**Multi-Scale Representation Networks for Time Series Classification**

Official PyTorch implementation of **MSNet** and **LS-Net**, two convolutional architectures designed for efficient and robust **time series classification (TSC)**.

The models exploit **multi-scale temporal representations** using parallel convolutional branches while maintaining strong computational efficiency.

This repository provides:

* Reference implementations of **MSNet** and **LS-Net**
* A minimal training pipeline
* A **one-command demo** using a sample dataset
* Architecture diagrams

The full experimental framework used in the paper (large-scale evaluation across 142 datasets) is not included in this repository.

# Overview

Time series classification often requires capturing patterns occurring at multiple temporal scales.
MSNet and LS-Net address this by combining **parallel convolutional filters with different receptive fields**.

## MSNet

A multi-scale architecture with three convolutional branches capturing short-, medium-, and long-term temporal patterns.

Key characteristics:

* Parallel convolutions: **k = 3, 5, 7**
* Feature fusion block
* Global average pooling
* Lightweight yet expressive representation learning

## LS-Net

A computationally efficient variant designed for fast inference.

Key characteristics:

* Two multi-scale branches
* Optional **early-exit inference**
* Reduced parameter count
* Designed for low-latency scenarios
